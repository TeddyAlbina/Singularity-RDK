This project builds a distribution project ("distro"), which is a complete, bootable
image of the operating system and applications.  The default distro is "BVT".  You
can select a different default by setting the environment variable SINGULARITY_DISTRO_NAME
to the name of the distro.  The name must identify a distro project file in the \Distros
directory, and must not include the ".proj" extension.  You can also set the distro name
when setting up your command-line environment, by specifying "setenv /distro <name>".
