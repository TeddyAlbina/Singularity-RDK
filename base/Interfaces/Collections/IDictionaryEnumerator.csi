    // positioned before the first element of the enumeration. The first call to the
    // MoveNext method brings the first element of the enumeration into view,
    // and each successive call to MoveNext brings the next element into
    // view until MoveNext returns false, indicating that there are no more
    // elements to enumerate. Following each call to MoveNext, the
    // Key and Value methods are used to obtain the key and
    // value of the element currently in view. The values returned by calls to
    // Key and Value are undefined before the first call to
    // MoveNext and following a call to MoveNext that returned false.
    // Enumerators are typically used in while loops of the form
